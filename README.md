# Linux-tutorials
Here, i will try to post useful content concerning the use and things to do with linux (preferably/only to do with debian)
Content I hope to cover includes the average desktop maintenance and customisation of GNOME, LXDE and XFCE. Also, I hope to cover the initial installation of debian (jessie) and a concise guide for newbies to debian linux. But then, that depends on me actually being bothered to do any of this.
